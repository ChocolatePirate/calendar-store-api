####What makes your content better/different from public calendars that are available?
We started SchedJoules because the quality of public calendars around the web is crappy. End users rely on the
data in their calendar so that information needs to be complete, accurate and timely. Those components often lack in
publicly available calendars. We offer the most comprehensive public calendar store worldwide. *** end of marketing

If there is an error in the content we fix it as soon as possible. You can actually talk to someone ;-)

####Why would I add public calendars to my mobile or web application?
From your users perspective: you offer a great service which save them time and gives them more control of their
calendar.
From your perspective: you offer your user a great service. You add an extra revenue stream.

####What do I need to do to get a calendar store to work?
1. Connect to our API
2. Design front end
3. Ship

To be honest that is the very short version. Especially step 2 will take your 'usual' time of developing a part of an
 application.
